            Friendship is one of the most precious gifts of life. One must live it, nurture it and live it. Friendship
            is
            one of the most innocent and pious relations known to mankind. Travelling itself is so thrilling but when
            we combine friendship and travelling, we get something very beautiful out of it. And the reasons why
            trips with friends are more convenient as compared to other trips:

            1. Understanding: They live the best part of school and college together with you. They know and
            understand you better than everyone. They are the other family, the family we choose. And
            especially when travelling we want a companion which is very much like us in order to shorten
            communication gap and have full benefit of the journey. We need someone with whom journey
            can be enjoyed at its fullest, who can see the trips as beautiful as we see it.

            2. Money: while travelling money is the issue everyone possessed at every point of time.
            Sometimes we spend extra, sometimes we don’t want to pay extra. Sometimes we hesitate
            because of the pressures of being cool in travelling group. But all these problems go away when
            we are travelling with friends, we do not hesitate when everyone is paying or doing a fun related
            activity. We do not hold back. We spend as we like. Sometimes we put our foot down but our
            friends understand it, they respect our decision and will. It is difficult to find a more suitable
            travelling partner than friends.

            3. Decisions: travelling has always been tricky when it comes to places to visit. Some people in
            group agree to some place, some don’t. Sometimes we go to places where none wants to go,
            instead had to go only because one person wants it to. But travelling with friends eliminates
            such kind of decisions and conversations. They are the exact replica of you. You have same taste
            in almost everything. So choosing destinations and spots to travel becomes lot easier. Choosing
            becomes a fun rather than a headache when travelling with a friend.

            4. Selfies: When we are travelling with a friend there is a part of us that makes us feel happy and
            joyful. We know that trip is going to be amazing and adventurous. We do every kind of nonsense
            and stuffs we used to do in schools and colleges. We not only are compatible with them, we are
            comfortable with them. We don’t pull ourselves back in front of them. We let go of ourselves in
            the madness and craziness of friendship. We are more free and alive in their company. And
            maybe because of these reasons we don’t hesitate to act weird and click tons of selfies with
            them.

            5. Relive: reliving college and school days can be most fun or most painful experience, the only
            difference is the company. And what is better company than an old friend who knows your
            every nerve and every emotion. Travelling with a friend is always a happy experience and the
            memory lane is once again in front of our eyes.
