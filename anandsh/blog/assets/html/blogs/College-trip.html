            Friendships are among the most complex but meaningful relationships in our lives. These unique bonds
            often run deeper than family ties, and sometimes last longer than our relationships with spouses or
            lovers.

            As we all know that academics are important but friends share an equal importance. We all have our
            moments with the group, still we spend little amount of time with each other. And even less with our
            college friends. Thanks to our education system, we are given an opportunity to have another family of
            friends in college. We share a bond beyond words, a family beyond blood. So don’t waste time, before it
            all ends let us go on an adventurous trip with our college friends. Yes you heard it right. College trip, an
            amazing way to have fun and strengthen our connection with our friends. We will not only have fun with
            friends and group, we will cherish a memory. For those whose lives revolve around academics and
            pleasing professors, this trip could be an educational one. Just choose a spot.

            Jokes apart, just like an initial interaction in the college; college trip is also an important part of
            curriculum. If you haven’t been on a college trip then your college life is incomplete. Everyone must
            have this experience. This is completely time changing experience. This stage in life is the one when you
            can get best of both worlds. Now is a time to grow up, take charge of your own life, explore new options
            in life.<br><br>
            <strong>Here is a list of things that you can do on a departmental trip:</strong>
        </p>

        <p id="main_content-1">
            1. It is a time to pursue your dreams: If you wish to be a travel blogger, travel agent, photographer
            and never had a time for your hobbies because of peer pressure, this is a once in a lifetime
            chance. You are with your friends, they support you and there is no best way to start a new
            chapter in life without your friends. Take some awesome photographs, travel places. You want
            to be a painter, go to art museum.
        </p>

            2. Time to make new contacts: This is time be a grown up now. Let us travel new places, meet new
            people, have some fun, increase our contact list just beyond family and friends. Meeting
            strangers is always a tricky concept but having new people in life give us a new perspective, a
            new way of looking at things and situations. And who knows whom we meet, a lifelong friend or
            a life partner.

            3. Time to show women empowerment: From time to time women are considered the repressed
            gender of society. By travelling different places, women not only show courage but also break
            the stereotype thinking of people. The only time to experience this is in college (college trips).

            4. Time to be a responsible human being: Everyone claims to be a human being but none think
            about showing humanity. On college trips you can go to under privileged places and explore the
            problems in other part of world .If you are thinking for joining any NGOs, social group, any
            administrative government job, this is a perfect timing and good way to start. If you are in some
            college dance-drama clubs, then you may perform for the masses to spread awareness just like
            in old times.

            5. Time to learn something new: If you are afraid of being alone, forests, animals, new people,
            darkness (go camping), or food at new places, it’s time to overcome these fears. Explore the
            culture, food, ethnicity, religion of places you are visiting. There is a peace in every religion, joy
            in every culture. Feel it.

            6. If you are a shopaholic: Shopping and souvenirs from new places is always a good memorabilia.
            More places you visit more are the photos for selfies, instagram, snapchat, facebook, vines,
            dubsmash. Go partying, go to concerts of your favorite band, rock star, singer, superstar.
